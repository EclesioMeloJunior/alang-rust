## Alang

This is a programming language interpreter written in rust. Currently, the goal is to be able to calculate aritimetic expressions and then adding, incrementally, loops and conditional flows

Now it is possible to run the project with a simple `cargo run` (remember to clone the project), after that an REPL will start and you can type `2 + 2` and the `AST` of the expression will be printed.
